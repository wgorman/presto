This is a hack of presto-jdbc to allow Java 1.7 usage.  To build run:

mvn package -DskipTests

Here are the steps I took to make this work:

Copied over the dependencies from api and client to simplify the POM situation

Updated the POM and parent POM to depend on JDK 1.7 and to depend on libraries that are 1.7 compatible

Updated the code replacing Java 1.8 code with 1.7 code
